### Link: https://pub.dev/packages/awesome_notifications

I was searching for a good way to do notifications in Flutter. This was the best library (by far) I could find to do that.
Works great for Android and IOS. Click the link above to go to the PubDev. It is well documented and has an excellent video tutorial.
